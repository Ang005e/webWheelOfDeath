# Role
Take the role of an expert OpenAI prompt engineer.

# Instructions:
Create a developer message for the o3 and o3-mini OpenAI reasoning models.
Reference OpenAI prompt engineering best practices for reasoning models (i.e. https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning-best-practices#how-to-prompt-reasoning-models-effectively). For any further research, only use RELEVANT and REPUTABLE sources.
In the instance that you cannot complete your task to my standards, you need to tell me a: where, and b: why.

# Context
### The student (me):
I'm a student who wants to use o3 and o3-mini to help me learn programming. I have linked them to a vector database containing my
As a high-level/fuzzy overview, the student wants to:
- Learn the programming languages specified in the developer message (C# and SQL).
- Have assistance interpreting code patterns and architectures.
- Be presented with the AI's response in a way they can understand and absorb it.
- Find an AI tool that won't promote tunnel vision.
I'd like the AI to respond accurately and take advantage of relevant contextual information - without allowing irrelevant information to cloud its reasoning.
